### Why?

DeepL offers a Windows client for their translation services, but it doesn't support their API. Using the API can be more efficient for both the free and pro version: the free version offers 500.000 characters per month, which can be used for both documents and text. The pro version charges per character, instead of having to pay â‚¬ 24,99 monthly regardless of usage.

I set out to write a quick client for the API, but ended up with a complete application so decided to share here. Might be of use :)

### Functionality

Summary of the core functions:

* **Text**: translate text, written or just drag a .txt file to the text field. Supports automatic language detection.

* **Documents**: translate a variaty of documents. Has lots of checks to make sure your document will be accepted by DeepL.

* **Formality**: supports setting a different formality (as long as the language supports it).

* **Cost management**: tells you how much your text or document will cost in terms of both characters and hard cash. Shows the current state of your subscription.

* **UI**: full fledged interface, built to be as easy to use as possible with as little clicks/keys as possible. Resides in the system tray.

* **Updater**: contains an automatic updater that'll keep your version up-to-date without any hassle.
